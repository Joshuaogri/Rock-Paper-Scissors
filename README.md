# Rock-Paper-Scissors

A replica of the rock-paper-scissors game. The intention is to simulate the popular game while trying to improve skills. Difficulties were significant because of the initial UI used which complicated efforts to redeploy a simple working product. However, a few tweaks here and there has allowed for a simple UI that can be easily understood. CSS flexbox was used to accomodate mobile concerns, however a few media queries were needed. The index.html file also contains some dormant elements meant to be used for results and making calls on verdicts. This is the <a href="https://joshuaogri.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors">live demo</a>.

## Challenges

- Issues of design can affect initial plans.
- Some flexbox issues.
